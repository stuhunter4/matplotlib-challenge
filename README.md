Apply Python Matplotlib to an animal study screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer.  In this study, 249 mice identified with SCC tumor growth  were treated through a variety of drug regimes.  Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured.  The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Capomulin versus the other treatment regimens.  For learning purposes.
